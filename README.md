# llama-7b
this is simple repo  for source code to run llama 7b on free google colab version 
 
  
  
  This is a repository for the implementation of Llama 7b Colab Notebook that uses a pretrained model from Hugging Face for Natural Language Processing tasks. The notebook also generates a disk map with the help of the Accelerator Library for efficient use of storage space.

The repository contains the following files:

llama_7b_colab_notebook.ipynb: This file contains the implementation of the Llama 7b Colab Notebook.

README.md: This file contains the information about the repository.

requirements.txt: This file contains the required dependencies for running the code.

Dependencies
The code is written in Python 3.8 and requires the following dependencies:

transformers
torch
tqdm
accelerator
sentencepie

Usage
To use the Llama 7b Colab Notebook, you can open the llama_7b_colab_notebook.ipynb file in Jupyter Notebook or Google Colaboratory.

The notebook provides the following functionality:

Importing the necessary libraries and the pretrained model from Hugging Face.
Loading the dataset for Natural Language Processing task.
Generating a disk map with the help of the Accelerator Library.
Preprocessing the dataset.
Training the model on the preprocessed dataset.
Evaluating the performance of the trained model.
